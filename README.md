# yun does dotfiles

Windows setup using the awesome [lukesampson/scoop](https://github.com/lukesampson/scoop/). An single powershell script that installs everything via mostly github. No need to fuss around with OneGet or Chocolatey 

OSX setup using [brew](http://brew.sh/) and [Brewfile](https://robots.thoughtbot.com/brewfile-a-gemfile-but-for-homebrew) coming soon.
